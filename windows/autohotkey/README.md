# Caps to Escape

This directory contains two files. One is the actual AutoHotkey script and the other is a Windows `.lnk` link/shortcut to the script. WSL is incapable of easily creating `.lnk` files so I copy the existing `.lnk` to my Windows startup directory to make the script start on boot/login.
