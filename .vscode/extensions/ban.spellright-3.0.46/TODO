    [+] Eng. Does not spell with dot! (<- multi language spelling backfire)

    [ ] Include embedded HTML (typeScriptReact etc...)

        _indent = 

    [ ] Spell attributes in XML documents
    [ ] Detect language from file name (split to parts, see if anything matches language code) - taken from speller for Visual Studio related to resource files (e.g. something.en.xml)
    [ ] Extra functionality: Go to first occurrence, Go to next/previous occurrence, List of suggestions to replace all occurrences, add all issues to dictionary

    [-] JSON with Comments gets parser automatically - why? (Because they are supported from inside of spellright)

    [+] All vars to consts in spellright.js

    [+] test.log in .spellignore disabled folder /test/ is WHITE off instead of RED.
    [+] Support multi root workspaces!
    [+] Support % [!TEX directives](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/78101/when-and-why-should-i-use-tex-ts-program-and-tex-encoding), especially spellcheck, e.g.: * !TEX spellcheck = en
