# Docker Support for Visual Studio Code

[![Version](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/PeterJausovec.vscode-docker.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterJausovec.vscode-docker) [![Installs](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/installs-short/PeterJausovec.vscode-docker.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterJausovec.vscode-docker) [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ms-azuretools/AzCode/_apis/build/status/vscode-docker)](https://dev.azure.com/ms-azuretools/AzCode/_build/latest?definitionId=8)

The Docker extension makes it easy to build, manage and deploy containerized applications from Visual Studio Code, for example:

* Automatic `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `.dockerignore` file generation (Press `F1` and search for `Docker: Add Docker files to Workspace`)
* Syntax highlighting, hover tips, IntelliSense (completions) for `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` files
* Linting (errors and warnings) for `Dockerfile` files
* Command Palette (`F1`) integration for the most common Docker commands (for example `docker build`, `docker push`, etc.)
* Explorer integration for managing Images, running Containers, and Docker Hub registries
* Deploy images from Docker Hub and Azure Container Registries directly to Azure App Service
* Debug .NET Core applications running in Linux Docker containers
* [Working with docker](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/docker) will walk you through many of the features of this extension

## Prerequisites

To use much of the Docker extension functionality, you will need to [install Docker](https://aka.ms/AA37qtj) on your machine and set up on the system path.

### Linux

Since VS Code runs as a non-root user, you will also need to follow the steps in “Manage Docker as a non-root user” from [Post-installation steps for Linux](https://aka.ms/AA37yk6) for the extension to be able to access docker.

## Generating Docker Files

Press `F1` and search for `Docker: Add Docker Files to Workspace` to generate `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.debug.yml`, and `.dockerignore` files for your workspace type:

![dockerfile](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/raw/master/images/generateFiles.gif)

> Note: The `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.debug.yml` files are not generated for .NET Core applications.

## Editing

Rich IntelliSense (completions) for `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files:

![IntelliSense for DockerFiles](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/raw/master/images/intelliSense.gif)

## Docker commands

Many of the most common Docker and docker compose commands are built right into the Command Palette (`F1`).

![IntelliSense](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/raw/master/images/commands.gif)

## Docker View

The Docker extension contributes a new `Docker` View to VS Code. Within the View, the Explorer lets you view and manage your Images, Containers, and browse your Docker Hub registry. If the [Azure Account](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account) extension is installed, you can browse your [Azure Container Registries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/) as well.

The right click context menu provides quick access to the same rich set of commands found in the Command Palette (`F1`).

![explorer integration](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/raw/master/images/explorer.png)

You can move the View up or down by dragging the Docker icon and you can hide the View by right clicking on the icon and choosing `Hide`. To bring it back, right click on the Activity Bar area and check the `Docker` item.

![show and hide the view](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/raw/master/images/viewRightClick.png)

The `showExplorer` configuration setting controls the visibility of the Docker View.

``` json
"docker.showExplorer": false
```

## Docker Hub Login

The first time you expand the Docker Hub node you'll be prompted to log in to your Docker Hub account.

![Docker Hub Login](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/raw/master/images/dockerHubLogin.gif)

Your user name and password are stored in your operating system credentials vault (for example macOS keychain, Windows Credential Store) so that you don't need to log in every time. You can log out of Docker Hub by right clicking on the Docker Hub label and choosing log out. This will delete the credentials from the OS store.

## Deploying images to Azure App Service

With the Docker Explorer you can deploy images from Docker Hub Registries or Azure Container Registries directly to an Azure App Service instance, as detailed in this [getting started](https://code.visualstudio.com/tutorials/docker-extension/getting-started) guide. This functionality requires installing the [Azure Account](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account) extension and an Azure Subscription. If you do not have an Azure subscription, [sign up today](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?b=16.48) for a free 30 day account and get $200 in Azure Credits to try out any combination of Azure services.

To log into Azure, press `F1` and search for `Azure Sign In`. You will then sign into your account using the Device Login flow. Click on "Copy & Open" to open your default browser.

![Azure Login](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/raw/master/images/devicelogin.png)

Paste in the access code and continue the sign in process.

![Azure Login](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/raw/master/images/devicelogin2.png)

You can now right click on an image in Docker Hub or an Azure Container Registry and choose "Deploy Image to Azure App Service".

![Deploy to Azure](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/raw/master/images/deploytoazure.png)

From here you will be prompted for a Resource Group, location, an App Service Plan, and a globally unique website name.

## Azure CLI

Microsoft ships the latest [Azure CLI](https://github.com/azure/azure-cli) as a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/azuresdk/azure-cli-python/). You can easily launch a container running the CLI from the Command Palette (press F1 and search for `Docker: Azure CLI`). The extension will then run an interactive terminal attached to the container.

After the container is started, you will be prompted to login to your Azure account. From there, set the subscription you want to work with using `az account set` (you can see all of your subscriptions with `az account list`). You do not need to login in every time you run the container because the extension volume mounts the local `$HOME/.azure` folder to the container's `$HOME/.azure` folder.

## Private registries (Preview)

This build includes preview support for connecting to private registries (such as those described in Docker Hub [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/)).  At the moment, OAuth is not supported, only basic authentication.  We hope to extend this support in the future.

## Self-signed and corporate certificates

If you are using a self-signed or corporate CA certificate (e.g. for a private Docker registry) and have the certificate authority's certificate registered in the Windows or Mac certificate store, you will want to use the following setting:
```json
"docker.importCertificates": true
```
This causes the extension automatically pick up system-wide certificates. Leaving it at the default `false` means the default Node.js list of trusted certificates will be used. You can fine-tune the values this way:
```json
    "docker.importCertificates":{
        "useCertificateStore": true,
        "certificatePaths": [
            "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates",
            "/etc/openssl/certs",
            "/etc/pki/tls/certs",
            "/usr/local/share/certs"
        ]
    }
```
The exact folder to use for certificatePaths on Linux will depend on the distribution.

## Debugging .NET Core (Preview)

> Note that Windows containers are **not** currently supported, only Linux containers. However, both standard and Alpine .NET Core runtime base images are supported.

### Prerequisites

1. (All users) Install the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) which includes support for attaching to the .NET Core debugger.

1. (All users) Install the [C# VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp) which includes support for attaching to the .NET Core debugger in VS Code.

1. (Mac users) add `/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/NuGetFallbackFolder` as a shared folder in your Docker preferences.

![Docker Shared Folders](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/raw/master/images/dockerSharedFolders.png)

### Starting the Debugger

To debug a .NET Core application running in a Linux Docker container, add a Docker .NET Core launch configuration:

1. Switch to the debugging tab.
1. Select `Add configuration...`
1. Select `Docker: Launch .NET Core (Preview)`
1. Set a breakpoint.
1. Start debugging.

Upon debugging, a Docker image will be built and a container will be run based on that image.  The container will have volumes mapped to the locally-built application and the .NET Core debugger.  If the Docker container exposes port 80, after the debugger is attached the browser will be launched and navigate to the application's initial page.

> NOTE: you may see errors in the debug console when debugging ends (e.g. "`Error from pipe program 'docker': ...`"). This appears due to debugger issue [#2439](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2439) and should not impact debugging.

Most properties of the configuration are optional and will be inferred from the project. If not, or if there are additional customizations to be made to the Docker image build or container run process, those can be added under the `dockerBuild` and `dockerRun` properties of the configuration, respectively.

```json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Docker: Launch .NET Core (Preview)",
            "type": "docker-coreclr",
            "request": "launch",
            "preLaunchTask": "build",
            "dockerBuild": {
                // Image customizations
            },
            "dockerRun": {
                // Container customizations
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Application Customizations

When possible, the location and output of the application will be inferred from the workspace folder opened in VS Code. When they cannot be inferred, these properties can be used to make them explicit:

| Property | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `appFolder` | The root folder of the application | The workspace folder |
| `appProject` | The path to the project file | The first `.csproj` or `.fsproj` found in the application folder |
| `appOutput` | The application folder relative path to the output assembly | The `TargetPath` MS Build property |

> You can specify either `appFolder` or `appProject` but should not specify *both*.

### Docker Build Customizations

Customize the Docker image build process by adding properties under the `dockerBuild` configuration property.

| Property | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `args` | Build arguments applied to the image. | None |
| `context` | The Docker context used during the build process. | The workspace folder, if the same as the application folder; otherwise, the application's parent (i.e. solution) folder |

}
```

## Configuration Settings

The Docker extension comes with a number of useful configuration settings allowing you to customize your workflow.

| Setting | Description | Default Value |
| --- |---|---|
| `docker.attachShellCommand.linuxContainer` | Attach command to use for Linux containers | `/bin/sh`
| `docker.attachShellCommand.windowsContainer` | Attach command to use for Windows containers | `powershell`
| `docker.dockerComposeBuild` | Run docker-compose with the --build argument, defaults to true | `true`
| `docker.dockerComposeDetached` | Run docker-compose with the --d (detached) argument, defaults to true | `true`

| `docker.imageBuildContextPath` | Build context PATH to pass to Docker build command | `""`
| `docker.languageserver.diagnostics.deprecatedMaintainer` | Controls the diagnostic severity for the deprecated MAINTAINER instruction | `warning`
| `docker.languageserver.diagnostics.directiveCasing` | Controls the diagnostic severity for parser directives that are not written in lowercase | `warning`
| `docker.languageserver.diagnostics.emptyContinuationLine` | Controls the diagnostic severity for flagging empty continuation lines found in instructions that span multiple lines | `warning`
| `docker.languageserver.diagnostics.instructionCasing` | Controls the diagnostic severity for instructions that are not written in uppercase | `warning`
| `docker.languageserver.diagnostics.instructionCmdMultiple` | Controls the diagnostic severity for flagging a Dockerfile with multiple CMD instructions | `warning`
| `docker.languageserver.diagnostics.instructionEntrypointMultiple` | Controls the diagnostic severity for flagging a Dockerfile with multiple ENTRYPOINT instructions | `warning`
| `docker.languageserver.diagnostics.instructionHealthcheckMultiple` | Controls the diagnostic severity for flagging a Dockerfile with multiple HEALTHCHECK instructions | `warning`
| `docker.languageserver.diagnostics.instructionJSONInSingleQuotes` | Controls the diagnostic severity for JSON instructions that are written incorrectly with single quotes | `warning`
| `docker.languageserver.diagnostics.instructionWorkdirRelative` | Controls the diagnostic severity for WORKDIR instructions that do not point to an absolute path | `warning`

| `docker.truncateLongRegistryPaths` | Truncate long Image and Container registry paths in the Explorer | `false`
| `docker.truncateMaxLength` | Maximum number of characters for long registry paths in the Explorer, including ellipsis | `10`

## Installation

In VS Code, open the Extension Viewlet, type in `Docker`, locate the extension and click on `Install`. Once the extension is installed you will be prompted to restart Visual Studio Code which will only take (literally) a couple of seconds.

Of course, you will need to have Docker installed on your computer in order to run commands from the Command Palette (F1, type in `Docker`).

## Running commands on Linux

By default, Docker runs as the root user, requiring other users to access it with `sudo`. This extension does not assume root access, so you will need to create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. Instructions can be found here: [Create a Docker group](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)

## Connecting to `docker-machine`

The default connection of the extension is to connect to the local docker daemon. You can connect to a docker-machine instance if you launch Visual Studio Code and have the DOCKER_HOST environment variable set to a valid host or if you set the `docker.host` configuration setting.

If the docker daemon is using TLS, the DOCKER_CERT_PATH environment variable must also be set (e.g. `$HOME\.docker\machine\machines\default`). See [docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/machine/reference/env/) for more information.

## Workaround for VS Code remote development

If you are running the extension via VS Code remote development, you will have to configure the remote instance (WSL, SSH machine, dev container) to run docker commands smoothly (like `docker run hello world`). First, install docker-cli in the remote instance.

In Windows subsystem for linux (WSL), you have to set the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable in linux to connect to Docker for Windows. See [here](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/setting-up-docker-for-windows-and-wsl-to-work-flawlessly) for more detailed instructions.

In SSH, the setup for docker is dependent on the machine environment.

There can be issues running the docker daemon from _inside the dev container_ (also called docker-in-docker). On the first build of the container, you might encounter an error about connecting to Docker. Follow [these docker-in-docker instructions](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/master/containers/docker-in-docker) to set up your dev container docker daemon, and the extension experience will mirror working on a local workspace.

## Legal

Before we can accept your pull request you will need to sign a **Contribution License Agreement**. All you need to do is to submit a pull request, then the PR will get appropriately labelled (for example `cla-required`, `cla-norequired`, `cla-signed`, `cla-already-signed`). If you already signed the agreement we will continue with reviewing the PR, otherwise system will tell you how you can sign the CLA. Once you sign the CLA all future PR's will be labeled as `cla-signed`.

## Troubleshooting

### I get "unauthorized: authentication required" in the terminal when executing some commands, such as "Docker: push".

Make sure you are signed in to the Docker Hub or Azure container registry from the docker CLI via `docker login` (using your username, not your e-mail address).

If you are using an Azure container registry, you will need to get the username and password from Azure by right-clicking on the Azure container registry in the extension and selecting "Browse in the Azure Portal", then selecting the "Access Keys" tab.
![Getting Azure username and password](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/raw/master/images/AzureUsernamePassword.png)

Finally, execute `docker login`, for example:

```bash
docker login exampleazurecontainerregistry.azurecr.io
```

and respond with the username and password specified by Azure.

### I'm on Linux and get the error "Unable to connect to Docker, is the Docker daemon running?"

Please see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) and the specific section on [Linux](#linux).

## Telemetry

This extension collects telemetry data to help us build a better experience for building micro-service applications with Docker and VS Code. We only collect data on which commands are executed. We do not collect any information about image names, paths, etc. The extension respects the `telemetry.enableTelemetry` setting which you can learn more about in our [FAQ](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting).
